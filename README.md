# 4-BIT-ALU
This is a simple 4-bit ALU implemented in Verilog. It accepts two 4-bit operands and a 3-bit operation selector to perform basic arithmetic and logical operations. Output includes 4-bit Result and status flags.
# Supported operations
*Addition
*Subtraction
*AND
*OR
*XOR
*~A
*~B
# Tools Used
* Icarus Verilog 12.0   (Simulation)
* EPWave (EDA Playground)	  (Waveform viewer)
# Language Used
* SystemVerilog
# Output
* 4-bit result
* Z flag shows 1 if result is zero.
* C shows carry/borrow  during addition and subtraction.
# Testing and Outcomes
* A testbench is included to test the output in each case.
* Learned basics of Verilog.
* How  ALU works , signal simulation and debugging.
* Learned to write testbenches.
